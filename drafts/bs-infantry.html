      <p><em>This post is about a weekend hack I put together involving a tiny JavaScript library that I wrote a while ago (I call it "infantry") and using it on BrowserStack for experimentation and fun.</em></p>

<h2>About Infantry</h2>

<p>The idea of Infantry came into existence a while ago, when I was reading about techniques used for parallel processing of large datasets. At the same time, I was intrigued by the idea of having a website and distributing your processing power across your visitors' machines. The idea seemed pretty cool to me, so I started my research and found <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/03/03/collaborative-map-reduce-in-the-browser/">this cool blog post</a> which meant people had already tried this and it might work. I also learnt about project <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a> which seemed very impressive to me considering how well they used the concept of collaborative computing and achieve some great results out of it. As a matter of fact, I regularly use BOINC to volunteer some of my idle CPU power.</p>

<p>Coming back to Infantry, I really wanted to build a small map-reduce libary in JS that can be used to parallelize simple logic across machines and run inside a web browser. After much procrastination, I decided to start working on it while I was on a 12 hours long flight. I tried to polish the framework further based on Google's map-reduce paper and ended up with something actually working.</p>

<p>The code has always been on GitHub and can be found <a href="https://github.com/dash1291">here</a>.</p>
