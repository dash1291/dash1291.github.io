      <p><em>This is one of the awfully long overdue posts I've had in my mind, but have not been able to make it on this space. But since its never too late, I'm writing about the cool project I was working on while interning at Mozilla during the summer of 2013.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com">Firefox Marketplace</a>, for the uninitiated is the platform where developers can host their Firefox apps which run on desktop and mobile (of course including Firefox OS). It acts as the central repository of apps, from where users can download and install apps on their systems. And by that I don't mean a plain repository of apps which just allows you to download apps, but also essentials like compatibility checks, app analytics, ratings, reviews, etc. Just like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Firefox Add-ons</a>, there are apps for various kinds of users on Marketplace. Since Mozilla cares much about the quality of the apps served to their users, it makes sure that the apps meet a quality standard before they are available on the Marketplace. For this purpose, there is process of App Review which comes after a new app is submitted to Firefox Marketplace and before it is available to the users for download.</p>
