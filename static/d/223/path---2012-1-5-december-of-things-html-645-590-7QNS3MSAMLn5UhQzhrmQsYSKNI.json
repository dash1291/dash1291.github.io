The month of December was about some travel, lot of sleep, occasional\nmovie sprints, and lastly but most importantly it was about taking my\nexperiences with Python some steps forward.The list of experiments included a\nhandful with Twisted including an incomplete(+ abandoned) networking project,\ngitpython, a small screen grabber(+ uploader) script and a couple of patches\ncontributed to one of the Mozilla.org websites that is\n<a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">addons.mozilla.org</a> a.k.a. AMO. These experiments\nthough not involving coding a huge project all the way, did well in teaching\nme some really important things both at fundamental levels and sometimes\narbitrary magic tricks.</p>\n<h2>Recap. Me Earlier with Python.</h2>\n<p>I started learning Python about 4 months back in September, last year. And it\nwas this time, that I realized that Python while being easy and quick to learn\ncan be very useful. I did my first Python work towards a special task which\nwas creating a script that runs as a daemon on my shared web host, crawls for\nartists on Last.fm, pull their biographical information and look for the\nlocation terms using Yahoo Placemaker API and eventually determine the\ngeographical location to which the artist belonged. I needed such a bot script\nto populate a database of artists with their geographical locations for my\nwebsite project which was about music discovery over geographical data. My\nshared host supported Python, I heard Python would be good for making such\nscripts, and I wanted to learn Python so it was an obvious to choose Python\nfor the script. Being a PHP programmer, I used analogies to PHP methods of\nparsing the web documents, and random smaller stuff to make a quick leap to\nlearning Python while directly coding my script. It was a smooth run, much\nmuch smoother than I had expected and apart from some nasty bugs which broke\nthe script sometimes, it worked really good. Good enough to give me enough\nartists to get the website live within 3 days after starting the script on my\nshared web host. </p>\n<p><strong>Enclosed Lessons</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Python has everything that PHP has. urllib, xml_minidom made me feel home.</li>\n<li>Life’s easier without braces.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Some Links</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkout the website. <a href=\"http://geonres.com\">Geonres.com</a> </li>\n<li>Checkout the source of the script on <a href=\"https://github.com/dash1291/geonres_bot\">GitHub</a>. </li>\n<li>Checkout the website source on <a href=\"https://github.com/dash1291/geonres.com\">GitHub</a>. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Exposure to the Community. PyCon India 2011</h2>\n<p>I registered for PyCon India before actually starting to work with Python\nwhich was because of my desire to learn the awesome language. I was really\nexcited as it was the first time that I was going to attend such a large\ncommunity meetup. Being interested in web development, I attended every\ntalk/session that gave me a hint of something that I could use to build web\napplications using Python notably including some like the low level web-\nscrapping tutorial, a talk on Redis, and another one on pyjamas. They came\nwith great learning and I got to know people who’ve been doing great things\nwith the awesome language that I was so wanted to learn. All that was a great\nmotivation package to keep up and working. </p>\n<p><strong>Enclosed Lessons</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>One can do pretty much anything, perhaps more things than any other language using Python, in ways that are easier and quicker.</li>\n<li>Python has an awesome community full of cool people who do cool stuff every day, every night and in every part of the globe.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Trying out things with Web Development with Python. Learning Django.</h2>\n<p>When I started learning Python, I knew I wanted to use it as one my tools for\ndeveloping web applications along with PHP. I heard the names of some web\nframeworks built in Python like Django, Google’s webapp, pylons, and web2py.\nWhen I visited PyCon India, I heard more about them and much more about Django\nand how much better it is than any of the Python web frameworks out there, or\nperhaps better than many web frameworks built in different languages too. I\nwanted to give it a wild try to learning it. I usually have a tendency to\nlearn while doing, but I didn’t have an idea of an application to start with\nso I though I would remake a web application that I earlier developed using\nPHP(I called it shitstream), but this time in Django. Since, it was my first\nattempt to any MVC framework, shitstream appeared to be a good choice to get\nsome basic concepts built up, as the app was simple and compact. </p>\n<p><strong>Enclosed Lessons</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Django is the best thing one can use to build web applications.</li>\n<li>Unless I’m out of choices or luck, I would never go back to PHP again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Checkout the source of Shitstream app on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dash1291/shitstream\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Helping make Web Better. Fixing @ <a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\">addons.mozilla.org</a></h2>\n<p>I wanted to contribute to Mozilla in any way possible since the day I got to\nknow about Open Source Software, about Mozilla, and how Mozilla keeps doing\nawesome things which make the web much more awesome than it was, or perhaps\nmuch more awesome than how it is now. But, with a huge rack of Mozilla\nprojects to choose from, my unawareness about them, and my lack of focus in a\nsingle field kept me confused whenever I wanted to give a try to contributing\nto one of the projects at Mozilla. But when I learnt Django, and accidentally\nbrowsing through the Web Dev projects at Mozilla’s Contribution page, I found\nmy thing. Having developed two Firefox addons earlier, I was aware of AMO, or\nI should say that I hung-out quite alot on that website. And, AMO being the\nfirst in the web dev projects list, I could not wait to browse through the\nbugs list and kick out a few of those annoying bugs. It did not take me long\nto fork the Mozilla’s github repository of Zamboni, clone it to my local box,\nand start trying to set it up. But setting up the whole thing, that is my\nlocal AMO instance took me 3 days. Yes, 3 days! It was actually a pain setting\nup the huge stack on my Ubuntu system. Thanks to folks on IRC, who are patient\ngreat helpers and played angels in helping me setting it up especially Jeff\nBalogh. Not only setup, but he also guided me to how to start fixing my first\nbug and led me all the way to my first pull request, which was much required\nfor me as it was not only my first attempt to fix a bug on this project, but\nalso my first attempt to fix anything on any open source project. My first\npull request although took a while to be closed with a merge of my proposed\npatch because it was awaiting review from the reporter and in the meantime I\nwas also busy with college. But as the winter break started, I got it merged,\nand also worked to fix a couple more bugs and got my patches merged. All the\nwhile I was working on these bugs, Mozilla developers hanging out on IRC were\nreally helpful while being prompt at suggestive code reviews especially Chris\nVan, who is also the commiter of all my patches to the original AMO git\nrepository. </p>\n<p><strong>Enclosed Lessons</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Most importantly, I learnt how to write code that is readable and stylish. Thanks to Mozilla’s adoption of PEP8.</li>\n<li>Ample of git stuff, I knew a very limited subset of git before starting to work on this project. I’m still terrible, but much better than what I was earlier.</li>\n<li>git rebase can be dangerous while working with a lot of people.</li>\n<li>find . -name “*.pyc” -delete is simple but can be magical sometimes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have a look at my commits merged with AMO\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/commits/master?author=dash1291\">here</a>. So\nthat was pretty much my Python story so far, and another of my favorite\nDecember. What I’ve figured out so far is that Python and Mozilla communities\nare two of the best Open Source Communities working to promote openness\neverywhere and Mozilla doing their every bit to build an open web platform\nwhich is not just about Mozilla Firefox but freedom and choice to the users of\nweb around the globe.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"December of Things","date":"January 05, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012/1/5/december-of-things.html","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011/10/29/django-apache-modwsgi.html"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up Apache Server for Django with mod_wsgi"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2012/4/17/opensource-wowness.html"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open source Wowness"}}}}
